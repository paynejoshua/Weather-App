# Weather-App

This weather-app uses an api from open weather to gather information about current weather, 5 day forecast, and the UV Index. This app allows the user to search for any city in any country and get the current weather, 5 day forecast, and UV index for that city. 

Overall this web application was challenging to build. I had to learn a lot of new development techniques in order to get this application to run correctly. The most challenging parts were: 
  -Getting the UV index by utilizing multiple promises in order to call multiple API's 
  -Setting the searched cities in local storage, displaying them onload of the page, and getting the forecast and current weather for those
  -When the page loads go through the saved city local storage array and grab the last city index and display the weather for that city. 
  
Enjoy!
